This is an update to a previously created project, namely one where I created a simple
command log based Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Whereas in that game, the game was played soloely through the command log, with this update, the game can be played via a rudimentary UI.

In working on this project I have learned a lot, and in particular, about DOM manipulation.
