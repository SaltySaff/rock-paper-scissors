This project will consist of a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It will be created using mainly JavaScript, though a bit of HTML will be necessary as well.

While the game at first will be rudimentary, it will be iterated on at a later date, with GUI being added at that time. For the time being however, the game will be played through the console.
